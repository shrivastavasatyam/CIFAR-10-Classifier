# CIFAR-10 Classifier

The goal of this project is to explore the task of image classification using both traditional machine learning and modern deep learning techniques. 

It is focused on implementing different classification algorithms on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 32x32 colored training images and 10,000 test images, labeled with 10 categories. 

To achieve this goal, we experiment with several popular machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest, alongside modern deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

We evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Furthermore, we compare their accuracy, convergence speed, and computational complexity. 

Finally, we analyze and discuss the results of our experiments and provide insights for future work. 

Overall, this project provides insights into the application of machine learning techniques for image classification tasks and sheds light on the performance tradeoffs of different algorithms.
